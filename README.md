# SwiftUI Color Picker App

This is a small practice project where I am learning **SwiftUI basics**, focusing on using `@State` and `@Binding` by building a simple **Color Picker UI**.

The goal of this app is to understand how data flows in SwiftUI using state properties and bindings, while experimenting with SwiftUI's built-in **ColorPicker** component.

## Features
- Built with **SwiftUI**
- Practice with **@State** and **@Binding**
- Select a color dynamically using **ColorPicker**
- Live preview of the selected color
- Simple reusable UI component

## Requirements
- Xcode (latest version recommended)
- iOS 15.0+
- Swift 5+
